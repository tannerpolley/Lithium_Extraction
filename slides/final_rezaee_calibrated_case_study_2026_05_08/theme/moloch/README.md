Moloch is a minimalist, feature-rich Beamer theme. It combines a clean, modern
design with extensive customization options to tailor your slides to your needs.

Moloch is a fork of the [Metropolis Theme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) and
was created for the following reasons:

- To fix some outstanding issues that had not been addressed for a long time.
- To remove some of the more opinionated design choices, such as special
  handling of the Fira family of fonts.
- To strip away some features that added complexity to the code base without
  achieving valuable functionality for the majority of users.

Please check out [the documentatioon](https://moloch.ink) for more information
on how to use the theme. If you're interested, there is also
[a blog post](https://jolars.co/blog/2024-05-30-moloch/) in which I introduce
the theme and write in more detail about the changes with respect to Metropolis.
Finally, please join us on
[Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#texlive-pkg-moloch:matrix.org) if you have any
questions or want to discuss the theme.

Do not expect this theme to be backwards compatible with the Metropolis theme.

## Installation

Moloch is on [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/moloch), so you can install it using
your favorite LaTeX package manager. For example, with `tlmgr`:

```bash
tlmgr install moloch
```

You can also install the theme from source, in which case you need a working
LaTeX installation with `l3build` installed. Then just follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jolars/moloch.git
cd moloch
l3build install
```

## Usage

The following code shows a minimal example of a Beamer presentation using
Moloch.
